#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It involves using structured methodologies, programming languages, and tools to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions.

Imporatnce:
1. Ensures Reliability – Proper engineering principles help create bug-free, high-performance software.
2. Improves Efficiency – Optimized software streamlines business processes, reducing costs and improving productivity.
3. Enhances Security – Secure coding practices protect data from cyber threats.
4. Supports Scalability – Well-engineered software can handle growing user demands, making businesses more adaptable.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1968 – Birth of Software Engineering
   Coined at the NATO Conference to tackle the software crisis, introducing structured development methods.
2. 1970s – Structured Programming
   Led by Edsger Dijkstra, promoting modular code with languages like C and models like Waterfall.
3. 1980s-1990s – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   Languages like C++, Java introduced OOP, improving code reuse, scalability, and maintainability.
4. 2001 – Agile Revolution
   Agile Manifesto shifted software development to iterative, flexible, and customer-focused approaches.
5. 2010s-Present – DevOps & AI Integration
   DevOps bridges development and operations for faster delivery, while AI automates coding and testing.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning – Define project scope, goals, and feasibility to ensure alignment with business needs.
2. Requirement Analysis – Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.
3. Design – Create system architecture, UI/UX, and database models to guide development.
4. Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and integrate the actual software code.
5. Testing – Identify and fix bugs through various testing methods like unit, integration, and system testing.
6. Deployment – Release the software for users, either as a full launch or in phases.
7. Maintenance – Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear and structured approach, best for stable projects like developing banking software, where strict regulations and documentation are required. Changes are difficult once development begins, and customer involvement is minimal until completion.

Agile is flexible and iterative, ideal for evolving projects like building a social media app, where user feedback drives frequent updates. It allows continuous improvements, quick adaptations, and regular delivery of working features.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer – Designs, writes, and maintains code to create software applications. They collaborate with designers and engineers, debug issues, and optimize performance for efficiency.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software to identify bugs, ensures it meets quality standards, and verifies that it functions as intended. They work closely with developers to resolve issues and improve reliability.
3. Project Manager – Plans, organizes, and oversees software development projects. They manage timelines, coordinate team efforts, and ensure the final product aligns with business goals and stakeholder expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
IDEs streamline coding by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform. They improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance productivity with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time debugging.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
VCS tracks code changes, enabling collaboration and rollback if needed. It ensures team members work on the same project without conflicts and maintains a history of modifications for debugging and audits.
Examples: Git (with GitHub/GitLab), Apache Subversion (SVN), Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging and Fixing Bugs – Use debugging tools, logging, and peer code reviews to identify and resolve issues efficiently.
2. Keeping Up with New Technologies – Stay updated through online courses, tech blogs, and developer communities like GitHub and Stack Overflow.
3. Managing Project Deadlines – Use Agile methods, task management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello), and clear prioritization to stay on track.
4. Handling Code Complexity – Write clean, modular code, follow design patterns, and use proper documentation to improve maintainability.

Effective Team Collaboration – Use Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git, hold regular meetings, and maintain clear communication.
To ensure smooth teamwork, software engineers should use Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git to manage code changes, hold regular meetings to align goals, and maintain clear communication through tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation. It helps catch bugs early and improves code reliability.
2. Integration Testing – Checks if different modules or services work together as expected. It prevents issues in communication between system components.
3. System Testing – Evaluates the entire application to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements. It verifies overall system performance and behavior.
3. Acceptance Testing – Ensures the software meets user requirements and business needs. It is the final validation before release, often performed by end users or clients.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is the practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to optimize responses from AI models. It involves structuring queries effectively to get accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.

Importance:
1.Enhances AI Performance – Well-crafted prompts improve response accuracy and relevance.
2. Increases Efficiency – Saves time by reducing trial and error in AI interactions.
3. Customizes Outputs – Helps tailor responses to specific needs, making AI more useful in various applications.
4. Improves User Experience – Ensures meaningful and context-aware interactions with AI systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about cars.

Explain the differences between electric and gasoline cars in terms of cost, performance, and environmental impact

1. More Specific – It narrows the topic to a comparison of electric and gasoline cars.
2. Clear Focus – Defines key areas: cost, performance, and environmental impact.
3. Concise & Direct – Avoids broad or ambiguous wording, making it easier for AI to generate a relevant and informative response.
